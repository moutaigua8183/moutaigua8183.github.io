Greetings,
======

I acquired my doctorate degree from ECSE department at RPI in 2022. My research mainly focused on question answering and information retrieval, but had broad interests in machine learning applications in multiple areas, such as dialogue systems, gaze tracking, gesture recognition, and other HCI applications.

Previously I was working on mobile eye gaze tracking with [Prof. Qiang Ji](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~qji/) in [Intelligent System Lab(ISL)](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~cvrl/). The idea was to use the front camera on mobile devices and deep learning approach to predict and track user's gaze. Starting from Summer, 2018, I started working in [Cognitive and Immersive Systems Lab(CISL)](https://cisl.rpi.edu/) co-advised by [Dr. Hui Su](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huisu/) and actively collaborating with [Dr. Mo Yu](https://sites.google.com/site/moyunlp/) from IBM on question answering systems. My projects mainly include Book QA, Mandarin Project, Spatial Context, Goal-Oriented Dialogue Systems and etc.


I joined Meta as a research scientist in June, 2022.
